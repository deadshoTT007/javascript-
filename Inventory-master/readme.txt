The way we work in this project is:

. We won't interfere with the lines of code of our fellow project partner to minimize conflict during merge.
. We will first tell about the stuff we will be working on and maximum lines required so in that way we won't write code on those lines.
. Everytime before working please git pull so that we can get latest version of project.
. Everytime before pushing your code in git please git pull to avoid conflict.(before git add)
. Always create a new branch while working on new stuff.
. Please feel free to add you idea and opinions. :)
