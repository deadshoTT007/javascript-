    <h2> Tribute to MA Long</h2>
    <p id="ma">Ma Long is a Chinese table tennis player. The current Olympic and World Champion, he is ranked number 3 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation. He has held the ranking of number 1 for a total of 64 months, the most by any male player in the history of table tennis.Arguably the best forehand attacker in table tennis history, Ma's playing style is that of the modern strategy of close-range third ball play. At the beginning of his career, his play strategy was primarily forehand-oriented, dominating play with powerful forehand loops, only using his backhand for controlled returns to set up the forehand. He still plays a forehand-oriented style, but his backhand has become more consistent, stable, and powerful as his career has progressed. Compared to when he was younger, he is much more confident using his backhand to attack and defend.</p>
    <h2>Tribute to Zhang Jike</h2>
    <p id="jk">Zhang Jike is a Chinese table tennis player. Zhang became the fourth male player in the history of table tennis to achieve a career Grand Slam when he won gold in men's singles at the Olympic games in London 2012. The first three are Jan-Ove Waldner, Liu Guoliang, and Kong Linghu.</p>
